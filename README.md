# EVE Scout Discord Bot üöÄ

A simple, efficient Discord bot written in Go that monitors the EVE Scout API for new wormhole connections and provides real-time notifications. It also allows users to query for currently active routes.

This project was built as a practical learning exercise in Go, covering API interaction, concurrency with goroutines, and Discord bot development.

***

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Notifications**: A background poller checks the EVE Scout API every 60 seconds and announces any new wormhole signatures in a designated channel.
* **Command Interface**: Users can interact with the bot using simple commands.
    * `!allroutes`: Lists the 10 most recent, active wormhole connections.
    * `!health`: Checks the current status of the EVE Scout API.
* **Graceful Shutdown**: The bot is designed to shut down cleanly when the process is terminated (e.g., via CTRL-C).
* **Configuration via `.env`**: All sensitive information and settings are managed through a `.env` file, keeping secrets out of the code.

## üîß Setup and Installation

# 1. Clone the repository (replace with your own git URL)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/thera-bot.git

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd thera-bot

# 3. Tidy up the Go modules to ensure all dependencies are present
go mod tidy
